### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  This is the private repo where I'm developing the Buffalo Fandalorian homepage

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making a public facing site for contacting me and what charities you can donate to if you like my work
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to do better frontend work in angular
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on charity site development for the Bills Mafia fandom
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with good ideas of who to help and what to boost
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about 3D printing, development, Buffalo Sports, nerdy stuff, and my opinion on the Noghri
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @thebuffalofand1 on twitter or email me at buffalofandalorian@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His/Mando
- âš¡ Fun fact: I always smile when I'm taking pictures, even with the helment on
